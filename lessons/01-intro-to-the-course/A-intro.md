Hello! And welcome to the Introduction to Flutter Development by [Maximiliano Firtman][twitter] ([firt.dev](https://firt.dev)).

This is a course to start with Dart and Flutter development to create apps for Android, iOS, Windows, macOS and PWAs published with [Frontend Masters][fem].

## Requirements

* You need a computer to install [Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) from macOS, Windows, Linux or Chrome OS. Follow the instructions to download the package and add it to your path folder. You should be able to run `flutter doctor` from a terminal.
* You can choose to use Visual Studio Code or Android studio to develop your app. In any case you need to install the Flutter plugin on top of the IDE.
* Install [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) available for Linux, macOS and Windows in case you want to emulate and compile for Android.
