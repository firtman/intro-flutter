Our app is ready so we can publish it as a Progressive Web App.

It's as simple as running `flutter build web` and publishing the `\build\web` output folder. You may want to edit the `index.html` and customize it to your needs, such as changing meta data, `<title>`, favicons and PWA `manifest.json`. See [Learn PWA!](https://web.dev/learn/pwa) for more details and insights about Progressive Web Apps; it's a free interactive ebook that I published on this topic :) Also, you have great PWA courses at Frontend Masters, including my workshop [Build Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) from Scratch
