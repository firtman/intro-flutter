It's time to finish our app for Android. 

* Open the folder `android/` in Android Studio.
* Look for the `build.gradle` file in the `App` folder and define your settings such as your desired packageId.
* In the `res/mipmap` folder, right click and select `New Image Asset`, pick the `icon.png` file from the downloaded assets, preview it, add margins and when you are ready save it as `ic_launch.png` replacing the default available one.
* Create the final APK/AAB from `Build Bundle/APK` menu from Android Studio or use the Flutter CLI using `flutter build appbundle` for AAB files (Play Store) or `flutter build apk` for APK files (for other installation purposes).
