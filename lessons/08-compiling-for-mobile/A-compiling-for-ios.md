It's time to finish our app:

* Within Xcode in your macOS computer open the file `ios/Runner.xcworkspace`
* Setup your app's settings, such as the name, the package and other settings
* Setup AppIcon within the `Assets` file in the navigator selecting `AppIcon`; replace all the Flutter icons with the corresponding app's icon from the assets.zip file you download, the `icons-ios` subfolder.
* Design a LaunchScreen if you want to
