It's time to finish our app:

* In the res/mipmap folder, right click and select `New Image Asset`, pick the `icon.png` file from the downloaded assets, preview it, add margins and when you are ready save it as `ic_launch.png` replacing the default available one.
* Create the final APK/AAB from `Build Bundle/APK` menu.


VoilÃ¡! Your app is ready! ðŸ¥³ 

Congratulations
